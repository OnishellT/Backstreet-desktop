🎤 Lyrics: Backstreet Boys - I Want It That Way

[Intro: AJ]
Yeah-eh-eh

[Verse 1: Brian & Nick]
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

[Chorus: Nick & All]
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

[Verse 2: AJ, AJ & Brian]
Am I your fire?
Your one desire
Yes, I know it's too late
But I want it that way

[Chorus: AJ, All & Brian]
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

[Bridge: Kevin, All, Howie, Kevin & AJ]
Now I can see that we're fallin' apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me
You are my fire
The one desire
You are (You are, you are, you are)
You might also like

[Interlude: Nick & All]
Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
(Don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (Oh, yeah)
I want it that way

[Chorus: All, Brian, Nick & AJ]
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say (Don't wanna hear you say)
I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say (Never wanna hear you say, yeah)
I want it that way

[Outro: AJ]
'Cause I want it that way
