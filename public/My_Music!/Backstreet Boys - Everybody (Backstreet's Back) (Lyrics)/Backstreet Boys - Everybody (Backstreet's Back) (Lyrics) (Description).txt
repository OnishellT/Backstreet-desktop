üé§ Lyrics: Backstreet Boys - Everybody (Backstreet's Back)

[Intro: Brian & All]
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body, yeah
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright

[Verse 1: AJ]
Hey yeah, oh
Oh my God, we're back again
Brothers, sisters, everybody sing
Gonna bring the flavor, show you how
Got a question for you, better answer now, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Nick, Brian & All]
Am I original? Yeah
Am I the only one? Yeah
Am I sexual? Yeah
Am I everything you need?
You better rock your body now

[Chorus: All]
Everybody, yeah (yeah)
Rock your body, yeah (yeah)
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright

[Verse 2: AJ]
Now throw your hands up in the air
Wave them around like you just don't care
If you wanna party, let me hear you yell
'Cause we got it going on again, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Nick, Brian & All]
Am I original? Yeah
Am I the only one? Yeah
Am I sexual? Yeah
Am I everything you need?
You better rock your body now

Rock your body, yeah (yeah)
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright

Don't be afraid, don't have no fear

As long as there be music
We'll be coming back again
[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
Everybody, yeah (yeah)
